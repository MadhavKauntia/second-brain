## Main Theme
What is the right thing to do? Introduction to moral philosophy through the lens of **utilitarianism** (maximizing happiness) and its challenges.

## Key Thinkers & Texts
- **Jeremy Bentham** – Founder of utilitarianism, argues morality = maximizing pleasure, minimizing pain.

## Key Concepts & Definitions
- Consequentialist - locates morality in the consequences of an act. Most influential example is Utilitarianism.
- Categorial - locates morality in certain duties and rights.

## Examples & Thought Experiments
- **Trolley Problem**: Should you divert a runaway trolley to kill one instead of five?
- **Lifeboat Cannibalism**: Is it acceptable for sailors to kill and eat one person to save the rest?

## Arguments & Counterarguments
- Argument (Utilitarianism):
	- Necessity and dire circumstances justify hard choices.
	- Numbers matter (saving more lives = better).
	- Wider effects (happiness vs. suffering) should be calculated.
- Counterargument:
	- Murder is murder, regardless of outcome.
	- Ignores individual rights and dignity.

## Reflections / Questions

- Do we have certain fundamental rights that can’t be overridden?
- Does a fair procedure (e.g., consent, majority rule) justify any result?
- What is the moral work of consent?
