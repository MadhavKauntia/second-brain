# Madhav's Second Brain

This is my evolving knowledge garden â€” a messy, interconnected web of notes, ideas, and half-formed thoughts from my journey as a software engineer, poker player, and perpetually curious human.

Think of it as my external brain: everything I'm learning, questioning, connecting, and probably overthinking. Tech insights, poker strategy, decision-making frameworks, philosophical tangents, and the inevitable rabbit holes that seemed important at 2 AM.

Fair warning: it's unfiltered and constantly changing. Some notes are polished, others are barely coherent. Welcome to how I actually think.
