# Madhav's Second Brain

This is my evolving knowledge garden — a collection of notes, ideas, and learnings from my journey as a software engineer, poker player, and curious human.

> I’m building this in public to make my thinking legible, connect dots, and track what I’m learning over time.



### 🧠 What you’ll find here:

- ⚙️ **Engineering & System Design** — architecture notes, patterns, and tradeoffs
- ♠️ **Poker Strategy** — thoughts on PLO, mental game, and session reviews
- 🛠 **Productivity & Tools** — workflows, templates, and second brain systems
- 📚 **Book Notes & Essays** — highlights, insights, and summaries
- ✍️ **Thinking in Progress** — half-baked ideas and questions I'm exploring
